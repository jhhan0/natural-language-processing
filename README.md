# Self-Learning Natural Language Processing ðŸ™‚

Useful reference for understanding about Natural Language Processing ðŸ“°ðŸ‘‰ [IBM: What is Natural Language Processing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/natural-language-processing)

Topics include text preprocessing, understanding keras documentation, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural network (RNN), Word2Vec and more. While uploading NLP tutorials in this repository, machine learning-related topics will be uploaded separately due to clear topic categorization. You may visit [this repository](https://github.com/jhhan0/machine-learning) if you are interested in machine learning and want to look tutorials that I've been studying. ðŸ˜„
