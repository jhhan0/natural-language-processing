# NLP (Natural Language Processing)

Useful reference for understanding about Natural Language Processing 📰👉 [IBM: What is Natural Language Processing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/natural-language-processing)

Topics may include text preprocessing, understanding keras documentation, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural network (RNN), Word2Vec and more. While posting NLP tutorials in this repository, machine learning-related topics will be uploaded separately due to clear topic categorization. You may visit [here](https://github.com/jhhan0/machine-learning) if you are interested in machine learning and want to look tutorials that I've been studying. 😄
